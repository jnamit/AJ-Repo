Hours later, well after the blast's violent rumble gave way to sirens and the victim's screams, a clearer sense of the human cost has emerged: At least 29 children under the age of 15, some as young as 6 years old, were killed in the attack, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Citing "local officials," the head of the international aid group's delegation in Yemen says that in total at least 50 people died and dozens more were injured."""
